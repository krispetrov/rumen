## Description

RUMEN is WEB application that allows you to play a game of chess with your friends. It consists of:

- **GUI** - Allows you to interact with the app, sends requests, checks for illegal moves etc.
- **API** - Controls users' requests and manages the database
- **SERVER** - Hosts the said above parts of the projects and manages sessions

The app originated as a Graduation Project for my Diploma and continues to grow every day since then.
The idea is that it lets you create your own chess room without having to register. After that you can
send your room code to your friend and they can join to play against you.
